      I'm David Burgos but my friends call me Burgos. I started in the world of coding
      when I was 17 years old thanks to my brother, and he has being a fundamental piece of my success ever since. 
      
      I've been working in the industry <strong>for more than 5 years</strong> 👷🏻‍♂️.
    </p>

    <p>
      I primary focus on <strong>Frontend Development</strong> and <strong>UI/UX Design</strong> 
      but I also feel like fish in the water 🐠 with <strong>Backend Development</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Currently, I work as contractor for
      <strong>a multinational staff augmentation firm</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had the opportunity to work with <strong>big companies</strong> from industries like 
      <strong>cannabis</strong>, <strong>health care</strong>, <strong>pharmaceutical</strong>, among others. 
      I excel in <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>high-quality</strong> in all my projects.
